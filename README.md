# Physics2D
Simple 2D physics engine in C#

This is a port of a 2D physics simulator I built for my master projects back in 2005. It was originally built in java to use with the MASON simulator (http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/). I recently ported it to C# to use to develop some simple games with my kids. It's buggy and not really ready for people to use, but feel free to see what you can get to work.

With the port there are some weird things that I wouldn't do if I had written it directly in C#. There are also two classes (Bag and Double2D) that were part of MASON. I didn't port those - just hacked together enough methods to get the physics engine to work. The originals were much better...
